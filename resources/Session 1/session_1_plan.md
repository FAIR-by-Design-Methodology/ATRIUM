# Unit Lesson Plan 

## FAIR-by-Design Session 1

The goal of the first part (the theoretical session) of the training program is to provide participants with a solid foundational understanding of the FAIR-by-Design Methodology, enabling them to comprehend the importance and practical applications of this concept in the context of creating and enhancing FAIR learning materials.

### Location
- online
- zoom room

### Total duration 2.5h

### Number of attendees
- 250+

### Learning objectives

Participants will be able to 

- identify and articulate the benefits of creating FAIR learning materials
- describe the stages of the FAIR-by-Design Methodology
- explain how the stages contribute to creating FAIR learning resources
- explain the role of metadata in making learning materials Findable and Interoperable
- describe the importance of accessibility in learning materials
- discuss the role of licensing (specifically Creative Commons) in promoting the reusability of learning materials
