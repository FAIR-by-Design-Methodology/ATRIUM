# FAIR-by-Design Session 1

The goal of the first part (the theoretical session) of the training program is to provide participants with a solid foundational understanding of the FAIR-by-Design Methodology, enabling them to comprehend the importance and practical applications of this concept in the context of creating and enhancing FAIR learning materials.

## Learning Objectives

Participants will be able to 

- identify and articulate the benefits of creating FAIR learning materials
- describe the stages of the FAIR-by-Design Methodology
- explain how the stages contribute to creating FAIR learning resources
- explain the role of metadata in making learning materials Findable and Interoperable
- describe the importance of accessibility in learning materials
- discuss the role of licensing (specifically Creative Commons) in promoting the reusability of learning materials

## Target Audience

- Instructional designers

## Duration

- 2.5h

## Prerequisites

- none

## Learning Tools

- QR code and link to interactive room will be provided by trainer
- rest of the materials are available on these pages

## FAIR-by-Design Methodology

Here goes the content of the learning unit divided into a number of subtopics and any additional headings as necessary.




## Summary

Creating truly effective and sustainable learning materials requires a conscious and systematic approach, guided by the FAIR principles and the FAIR-by-Design Methodology. Participants should leave with a clear understanding that:

- FAIR is not just a buzzword: It's a set of actionable principles that significantly enhance the impact of educational resources.
- Planning is essential: The FAIR-by-Design Methodology provides a structured framework for planning, creating, and maintaining FAIR learning materials. Â  
- Metadata, accessibility, and licensing are crucial: These elements are not afterthoughts but integral components of FAIRness.
- A strong theoretical foundation is the key to practical success: Understanding the "why" behind FAIR helps effectively apply the "how".
