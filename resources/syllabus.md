abstract: "This training program is designed to equip participants with the knowledge and practical skills to create and enhance learning materials using the FAIR-by-Design Methodology. It begins with a theoretical foundation, exploring the core principles of FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) and their application in the development of learning materials. The program then transitions to a hands-on workshop, where participants assess and improve the FAIRness of existing learning materials, covering metadata enhancement, accessibility improvements, and reusability strategies. Through practical exercises, participants gain experience in applying the FAIR-by-Design stages to create sustainable and impactful educational resources."

## Training Description

This training program is designed to equip participants with the knowledge and practical skills to create and enhance learning materials using the FAIR-by-Design Methodology. It begins with a theoretical foundation, exploring the core principles of FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) and their application in the development of learning materials. 

The program then transitions to a hands-on workshop, where participants assess and improve the FAIRness of existing learning materials, covering metadata enhancement, accessibility improvements, and reusability strategies. Through practical exercises, participants gain experience in applying the FAIR-by-Design stages to create sustainable and impactful educational resources.
