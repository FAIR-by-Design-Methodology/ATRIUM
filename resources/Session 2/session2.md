# Hands-on Session

In this session, we move beyond theory and dive into the practical application of the FAIR-by-Design Methodology. We'll be working with existing learning materials, putting on our 'FAIRness detective' hats to evaluate their current state and then systematically enhance them. Through a series of focused activities, we'll address metadata improvements, accessibility enhancements, and strategies for maximizing reusability. This is your opportunity to gain real-world experience, collaborate with your peers, and leave with tangible skills that you can immediately apply to your own learning resource development.

## Learning Objectives

- apply the FAIR-by-Design stages to enhance the FAIRness of a provided learning material
- use validation tools to check the FAIR compliance of learning materials
- implement metadata enhancements
- analyse accessibility improvements (e.g., alt text, captions, transcripts) to a provided learning material
- apply strategies to improve the reusability of a learning resource (e.g., modularization)

## Target Audience

- ATRIUM instructional designers

## Duration

- 4 hours

## Prerequisites

- session 1 of this training

## Learning Tools

- GoogleDocs based templates
- external links to existing learning materials
- FAIR-by-Design QA checklist
- Accessibility checker

## Overview of the hands-on activities

In this hands-on workshop, we'll begin by directly assessing the FAIRness of provided existing learning materials using a dedicated QA checklist. Following this initial evaluation, we'll systematically apply the FAIR-by-Design Methodology. First, we'll Prepare by refining learning objectives and identifying gaps through the lens of Bloom's Taxonomy. Then, we'll Design by enhancing the metadata schema using the RDA minimum schema, focusing on completeness and accuracy. During the Discover phase, we'll conduct an attribution check using the TASL method to ensure proper credit and licensing. We'll further Design by restructuring the materials into logical, reusable modules. In the Produce phase, we'll implement accessibility improvements using online checkers and then outline a comprehensive instructor kit. Throughout the session, we'll engage in peer review, culminating in a summary Q&A session. This structured approach will provide you with practical experience in enhancing the FAIRness of learning materials, preparing you to apply these skills in your own work.
