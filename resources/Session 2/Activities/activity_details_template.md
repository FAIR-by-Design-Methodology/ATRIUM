# Hands-On FAIR-by-Design Workshop

This workshop provides participants with practical experience in enhancing the FAIRness of existing learning materials using the FAIR-by-Design Methodology. Through a structured process, participants assess, plan, design, and improve learning resources, focusing on metadata, accessibility, and reusability. Peer review, validation tools, and collaborative activities reinforce learning and ensure practical application.

## Activity duration 3.25h

## Number of people that it can be performed with: max 5-6 per breakout room

## Goal of activity



## Materials
- Slides:
    - Introduction to FAIR-by-Design
    - Workshop overview and agenda
    - Brief recap of Bloom's Taxonomy
    - TASL method explanation
- Documents:
    - FAIRness Assessment Checklist (Excel/Google Sheets)
    - RDA Minimum Metadata Schema (PDF or link)
    - Google Docs Template (for documenting changes)
    - Example Existing Learning Resources (4 different resources)
- Tools:
    - Accessibility Checker (browser plugin, e.g., WAVE, axe DevTools)
- Platforms:
    - Online meeting platform (e.g. Zoom, Google Meet)
    - Breakout room functionality
    - Google Docs (or similar collaborative platform)

## Instructions

1. Workshop Setup:
    - Prepare Learning Materials:
        - Select four diverse existing learning resources for the breakout groups. They can vary in format and complexity.
        - Review/Adapt slides with key information and visuals.
    - Set Up Breakout Rooms:
        - Create four breakout rooms in your online meeting platform.
        - Assign 5-6 participants and one trainer to each room.
    - Distribute Resources:
        - Share the links to the learning resources and document templates with the trainers and participants.
    - Test Tools:
        - Ensure that all trainers and participants can access and use the accessibility checker and other online tools.
2. Existing Learning Materials:
    - Introduce the context and purpose of the existing learning materials.
    - Divide participants into breakout groups and assign resources.
    - Provide a short overview of the day's todo list.
3. FAIR-by-Design Methodology:
    - Brief recap of the FAIR principles and FAIR-by-Design stages.
4. Continue in each breakout room
    - Part 1: FAIR-by-Design QA Checklist (30 mins):
        - Participants assess the FAIRness of their assigned resources.
        - Trainers facilitate discussions and answer questions.
    - Part 2: SMART Learning Objectives (25 mins):
        - Participants refine or create SMART learning objectives.
        - Trainers provide guidance on Bloom's Taxonomy and SMART criteria.
    - Part 3: Metadata Schema (30 mins):
        - Participants enhance the metadata using the RDA minimum metadata schema.
        - Trainers assist with controlled vocabularies and PIDs.
    - Part 4: Attribution (20 mins):
        - Participants check and enhance attributions using the TASL method.
        - Trainers provide guidance on licensing and copyright.
    - Part 5: Structure (20 mins):
        - Participants improve the logical structure and granularity.
        - Trainers help with modularization and microlearning principles.
    - Part 6: Accessibility (25 mins):
        - Participants implement accessibility improvements using online checkers.
        - Trainers provide guidance on alternative text and WCAG guidelines.
    - Part 7: Formats, Learning Experience and Versioning (25 mins):
        - Participants discuss interactive elements, file formats, and versioning.
        - Trainers guide discussions on feedback mechanisms and continuous improvement.
5. Back to main room
    - Q&A: Open floor for questions from all participants.

## Tips and Tricks

- Facilitate, Don't Dictate: Guide participants through the activities, but encourage them to think critically and make their own decisions.
- Provide Context: Explain the purpose and relevance of each activity.
- Encourage Collaboration: Promote discussion and peer learning within the breakout groups.
- Answer Questions: Be prepared to answer questions about the FAIR principles, metadata, accessibility, and other related topics.
- Manage Time: Keep track of time and ensure that participants stay on schedule.
- Document Progress: Encourage participants to document their changes and decisions.
- Provide Feedback: Offer constructive feedback on participants' work.
- Debrief: Facilitate a thorough debriefing session in the main room.
- Resource Navigation: Be prepared to point the attendees to the proper resources.
- Provide regular time updates to participants.
- Encourage participants to share their experiences and perspectives.
- Ensure that any links are working.
- When Debriefing, ensure that each breakout room shares their findings.
