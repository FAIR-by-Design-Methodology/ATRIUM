# Session 2 Plan

## FAIRification of existing learning resources

The goal of the second session (the hands-on workshop) is to provide participants with practical experience in applying the FAIR-by-Design Methodology to enhance the FAIRness of existing learning materials, enabling them to develop the skills and confidence necessary to create and maintain high-quality, sustainable educational resources.

### Location
- online
- zoom room with breakout rooms

### Total duration 4h

### Number of attendees
- max 25
- 5-6 people per room

### Learning objectives
- apply the FAIR-by-Design stages to enhance the FAIRness of a provided learning material
- use validation tools to check the FAIR compliance of learning materials
- implement metadata enhancements
- analyse accessibility improvements (e.g., alt text, captions, transcripts) to a provided learning material
- apply strategies to improve the reusability of a learning resource (e.g., modularization, clear licensing)
