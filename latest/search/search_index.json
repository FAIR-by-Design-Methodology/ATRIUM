It begins with a theoretical foundation, exploring the core principles of FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) and their application in the development of learning materials. The program then transitions to a hands-on workshop, where participants assess and improve the FAIRness of existing learning materials, covering metadata enhancement, accessibility improvements, and reusability strategies. Through practical exercises, participants gain experience in applying the FAIR-by-Design stages to create sustainable and impactful educational resources. Target audience: ATRIUM instructional designers Expertise Level / Skill Level: Beginner Primary Language: English Access Cost: N Prerequisites none Duration 6.5 h Training objectives By the end of the theoretical session, participants will be able to accurately define and explain the activities defines within the FAIR-by-Design Methodology and their relevance to developing FAIR learning resources participants will be able to apply the FAIR-by-Design stages to enhance the FAIRness of a provided learning material Keywords FAIR Principles, FAIR-by-Design Methodology, Learning Materials, Metadata, Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, Reusability, Licensing, Version Control, Collaboration, Continuous Improvement Agenda: Training Schedule Session 1 Date/Time Topic 14.03.2025 10.00-12.30 FAIR-by-Design Methodology Deep Dive Session 2 Date/Time Topic 21.03.2025 10.00-16.00 Hands-on FAIRification of existing learning materials using the FAIR-by-Design Methodology Resources and Materials All necessary learning materials are provided via links on these pages Certification Information no certification is offered for this training Author(s) Sonja Filiposka Trainer(s) Sonja Filiposka , Anastas Mishev , Bojana Koteska , Vojdan Kjorveziroski Contact information if you have any questions or comments please reach out to sonja.filiposka@finki.ukim.mk License This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License .

If you are reusing images or text clear attribution should be provided as in the example above. Same applies in case of reusing text or other type of content. Be careful to follow the attribution rules as provided by the image source (in the example above it is Pixabay).
