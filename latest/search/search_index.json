This methodology ensures that learning materials, such as course content, training modules, and educational resources, are not only well-structured and high-quality but also meet specific criteria that make them easier to discover, use, and adapt within the Open Science ecosystem. In this way the methodology guarantees that the produced materials will be FAIR not just from the point of view of the learners, but also other designers and trainers that would like to reuse and adapt the materials for their own purposes. FAIR-by-Design Methodology Stages The FAIR-by-Design Methodology is created around the popular backward instructional design process that is used to develop high-quality learner-centric materials. We have taken the steps of the backward instruction design process and added additional considerations to ensure that the process will be aimed towards the design of FAIR learning content from both the perspective of the learners and the perspective of the instructional designers and trainers. The methodology is broken down into a number of stages that are connected in a feedback loop thus enabling continuous improvement: Prepare In the Prepare stage the instructional designers need to expand their skillset so that they can practically implement the FAIR principles . This means that in addition to the traditional instructional design skills, they should also be able to work with PIDs, repositories and catalogues, use a corresponding metadata schema, choose a license, and know how to acknowledge reused work with attribution. One of the important tasks in this stage is to familiarize with the RDA minimal metadata schema for learning resources as this is the basis for the description of the FAIR learning materials. This is when the backward learning process begins: Step 1 : What are your desired effects, i.e. learning outcomes? Step 2 : How are you going to assess the learners' achievements? Step 3 : How should you structure the material to reach them? This is the initial stage of the learning materials development process and thus it is important that in this stage the designer clearly defines the purpose of the learning materials, the target audience and the learning objectives while taking into consideration any prerequisites. Purpose When and how the learning materials can be used and for what purposes? Target Audience Is there anything specific that needs to be taken into account, such as cultural context? Prerequisites What does the target audience need to know or understand before starting the learning process? Scope Is it going to be a single learning unit, or a group such as a course? Learning Objectives What competences will be gained after successful completing of the learning process? Objectives should be S pecific, M easurable, A ttainable, R elevant and T ime-bound. Use Blooms Taxonomy: Formulate the objectives as actionable verb + observable knowledge, skill, attitude, behavior or ability. Discover Once the vision of what needs to be created is clear, the next step is to discover any existing learning materials that can be reused or simply serve as inspiration. For these purposes the designer needs to search different types of repositories that might host similar learning materials including OER repositories, learning platforms, general repositories and catalogues, as well as multimedia repositories that can provide sources of audio/visual props that are essential in multi-modal learning. OER DOAB MERLOT OASIS OER Commons OERTX CORA GALILEO FORRT EOSC_ Most EOSC projects have their own training catalogues and/or platforms... General Creative Commons Search - content provided under a CC license Zenodo - a multi-disciplinary open repository OSF - a free, open research platform Design At this stage the designer has a clear idea of what is needed and what already exists. The next step is to sketch a conceptual map of the learning materials that will help crystalize the ideas and prepare the syllabus for the learning materials. The syllabus is then used as a high-level blueprint for the development of the learning materials. In the design stage the overall structure of the learning materials is defined identifying all modules and learning units necessary together with the information on what can be reused and what needs to be designed from scratch. Careful attention should be put on license compatibility during this work. Tip Create an intuitive logical organisation of all learning materials. Tip The goal is for other people to easily reuse a single item (plan, activity, unit, assessment, ...). Tip Use a hierarchical structure to combine learning units into larger compositions. Upon completing the structure, each learning unit needs to be designed using a modeling technique such as the Hunter's model. The design stage should also take into account the need for development of a facilitation guide that explains in details how to prepare and put the training into practice, as well as a feedback form that should be used to gather feedback after the learning process has finished Produce When the design is complete, it is time to move to the produce stage and choose the tools and file formats necessary to develop all of the content. Care must be taken that the chosen file formats are open so that reusability is supported, and it is recommended that a collaborative, versioning system is used to keep track of all contributions and changes. It is important to consider both the editable files that can be reused by trainers and the final file formats intended for learners. Collaborative environment for team work Choose an environment for producing the learning material that will enable multiple people to work on the same material at one. Two examples are workplace or GitHub (find out more here ). Replicate the folder tree in the environment and start using the provided templates to generate the content. Granular versioning for easy rollback Versioning helps you maintain control over your changes. If the collaborative environment does not provide versioning and history retention then keep a history of the files by adopting a naming convention such as combining the file name with an increasing version number. Open file formats to foster reuse For other people to reuse your materials they should be made available using open file formats (docx, pptx, pdf, md, html, etc.). If you use close file formats then you MUST clearly state the tools that have been used for development in your README file. Multimodal content to reach all audience Don't forget to include different types of multimedia to provide support for different learning modalities: read/write, auditory, visual, kinesthetic. Two file sets: editable + final Always work with and keep a history of your editable files. These are what matters for you and other instructors. The second set of final files should be obtained from the editable when needed (before distributing them to the learners). The final files should be kept on the learning platform only. In this way you don't need to worry about keeping the versions in sync. Don't forget to support co-creation Truly FAIR learning materials should enable co-creation with external parties. If you don't use a collaborative environment that supports this from the start (such as GitHub), then think how are you going to enable this in the future and how are you going to deal with versioning then. One of the most important aspects of the produce stage is accessibility of the developed learning materials . Accessibility standards should be followed so as to maximize the audience for the learning materials. During this stage the designers must not forget to add the human-readable and machine-readable metadata in the developed content as well as to develop the content of all facilitation documents such as the guide, activities description, lesson plans, etc. The final step in the produce stage is to perform an internal Quality Assessment that will check that all elements are present and that the content is adequate. Publish A satisfactory completion of the internal QA leads to the publication steps. Before the actual publication, very important final touches need to be done including activities such as the definition of the content of accompanying files : license, readme, citation, code of conduct and alike. Accompanying files Define the overall license, provide description, instructions on how to cite your materials, define the code of conduct for a co-creation environment, etc. Put into repository Publish the editable package in an appropriate FAIR repository. This record is primarily intended for reuse by other designers and trainers. Provide to learners Provide the final non-editable versions to the learners on a learning platform of your choice. Some additional guidelines on FAIR repositories are available at Find a FAIR repository . One of the available options is to use fairsharing.org to search for a suitable FAIR repository. fair-checker to check the FAIRness of a given repository. It is important to also consider adding a reference to the repo in a corresponding catalogue such as the SSH Open Marketplace if this is not done by automatic harvesting of the chosen repository. Verify The final steps in the methodology is to perform another QA round, this time focusing on external QA . At this stage the overall level of FAIRness of the learning materials needs to be checked and external experts should be used to provide unbiased feedback regarding the quality of the produced materials. A fresh set of eyes Have someone who has not participated in the development of the learning materials review the final work. This will guarantee a review free of cognitive bias. Don't forget to QA the Learning Management System (LMS) The reviewer should play the role of a new learner in the LMS and check everything from the learner perspective. Go through the QA checklists In Skills4EOSC T2.4 has developed a number of QA checklists that you and your external reviewer need to go through so that you can ensure high-quality learning materials (see S\u00e1nchez et al. 2023 ). This stage also focuses on setting up different mechanism for gathering feedback so that the learning materials can be further improved. In this way it fosters the co-creation process that empowers learners and other designers and trainers to actively participate in the development. Continuous Improvement The gathered internal and external feedback should be used as input for the development of a new version of the learning materials. Upon the identification of potential improvements that should be implemented, the development process circles back to the first stage aiming to publish a new improved version of the learning materials. Gather Gather feedback from all available internal & external sources. Analyse Analyse the gathered information in a structured way. Create a list of potential improvements with impact level (high, moderate, low). Improve Select items from the list that will be part of a new version. Choose items that make sense to be in the same new release. Repeat Start a new cycle of the FAIR-by-Design methodology that will implement the selected items. After the Verify stage, you will reenter continuous improvement with newly gathered information.... Summary Creating truly effective and sustainable learning materials requires a conscious and systematic approach, guided by the FAIR principles and the FAIR-by-Design Methodology. Participants should leave with a clear understanding that: FAIR is not just a buzzword: It's a set of actionable principles that significantly enhance the impact of educational resources. Planning is essential: The FAIR-by-Design Methodology provides a structured framework for planning, creating, and maintaining FAIR learning materials. Metadata, accessibility, and licensing are crucial: These elements are not afterthoughts but integral components of FAIRness. A strong theoretical foundation is the key to practical success: Understanding the \"why\" behind FAIR helps effectively apply the \"how\".

We'll be working with existing learning materials, putting on our 'FAIRness detective' hats to evaluate their current state and then systematically enhance them. Through a series of focused activities, we'll address metadata improvements, accessibility enhancements, and strategies for maximizing reusability. This is your opportunity to gain real-world experience, collaborate with your peers, and leave with tangible skills that you can immediately apply to your own learning resource development. Learning Objectives apply the FAIR-by-Design stages to enhance the FAIRness of a provided learning material use validation tools to check the FAIR compliance of learning materials implement metadata enhancements analyse accessibility improvements (e.g., alt text, captions, transcripts) to a provided learning material apply strategies to improve the reusability of a learning resource (e.g., modularization) Target Audience ATRIUM instructional designers Duration 4 hours Prerequisites session 1 of this training Learning Tools GoogleDocs based templates external links to existing learning materials FAIR-by-Design QA checklist Accessibility checker Overview of the hands-on activities In this hands-on workshop, we'll begin by directly assessing the FAIRness of provided existing learning materials using a dedicated QA checklist. Following this initial evaluation, we'll systematically apply the FAIR-by-Design Methodology. First, we'll Prepare by refining learning objectives and identifying gaps through the lens of Bloom's Taxonomy. Then, we'll Design by enhancing the metadata schema using the RDA minimum schema, focusing on completeness and accuracy. During the Discover phase, we'll conduct an attribution check using the TASL method to ensure proper credit and licensing. We'll further Design by restructuring the materials into logical, reusable modules. In the Produce phase, we'll implement accessibility improvements using online checkers and then outline a comprehensive instructor kit. Throughout the session, we'll engage in peer review, culminating in a summary Q&A session. This structured approach will provide you with practical experience in enhancing the FAIRness of learning materials, preparing you to apply these skills in your own work. Organisation In this session the hands-on activities will be performed in breakout rooms with 5-6 people per room. Each room will be guided by a trainer and will get the links to their use-case (existing learning resources). At the and the participants will come together for a final debrief and Q&A. Part 1: FAIR-by-Design QA checklist Steps: Familiarize Yourself with the Learning Material: Take a few minutes to review the learning material. Understand its purpose, content, and target audience. Note the format of the material (e.g., text document, video, interactive module). Review the FAIRness Assessment Checklist: Carefully review the provided FAIRness Assessment Checklist. Ensure you understand each criterion and how it relates to the FAIR principles. Ask your trainer for clarification if needed. Assess the FAIRness of the resource Use the provided Excel/Google Sheets template (or a document) to record your findings. Be specific and look for examples to support your assessments. Note any areas where the material is lacking in FAIRness. Discuss Your Findings: Discuss your findings with your group and trainer. Identify the most significant areas for improvement. Prepare to share your findings during the debriefing session. Tips: Be objective and thorough in your assessment. Focus on the practical aspects of FAIRness. Don't hesitate to ask your trainer for assistance. Remember that the goal is to improve the materials, so be constructive in your critique. Part 2: SMART learning objectives Steps: Review the Existing Learning Objectives (If Any): If the learning material already has learning objectives, review them. Assess if they are SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound). Note any areas where they can be improved. Refer to Your FAIRness Assessment: Use your findings from the FAIRness assessment to identify areas where the learning material can be improved. Consider how these improvements can be translated into learning objectives. Use Bloom's Taxonomy: Use Bloom's Taxonomy to ensure a range of cognitive levels in your objectives (Remembering, Understanding, Applying, Analyzing, Evaluating, Creating). Start with lower-level objectives (e.g., remembering key terms) and progress to higher-level objectives (e.g., applying concepts to solve problems). Consider what level of learning the learning object is aiming to teach. Craft SMART Learning Objectives: For each identified improvement, create a SMART learning objective: Specific: Clearly define what learners will be able to do. Measurable: Include criteria for measuring learner achievement. Achievable: Ensure the objective is realistic and attainable within the context of the learning material. Relevant: Align the objective with the purpose and content of the learning material. Time-bound: If applicable, include a timeframe for achieving the objective. Example Objectives: Example 1 (Metadata): \"By the end of this module, learners will be able to accurately identify and populate all mandatory fields of the RDA minimum metadata schema for this learning resource, using controlled vocabulary for subject terms.\" Example 2 (Accessibility): \"Learners will be able to create accurate alternative text descriptions for all images in the learning resource, ensuring accessibility for visually impaired users.\" Example 3 (Reusability): \"Learners will be able to identify at least three distinct modules within the learning resource that can be reused in different educational contexts.\" Document Your Objectives: Use the provided Google Docs (or a similar document) to record your SMART learning objectives. Include a brief explanation of how each objective maybe relates to other FAIRness improvements. Discuss and Refine: Discuss your objectives with your group and trainer. Refine your objectives based on feedback and suggestions. Tips: Focus on objectives that directly address the identified context. Use action verbs to clearly define what learners will be able to do. Ensure your objectives are learner-centered and focused on outcomes. Keep your objectives concise and easy to understand. Remember that the learning objectives should drive the improvements you make to the learning material. Part 3: Metadata schema Steps: Review the RDA Minimum Metadata Schema: Carefully examine the fields defined in the RDA minimum metadata schema for learning resources. Understand the purpose and requirements of each field. Note that all fields are mandatory (this is the minimal schema). Compare Existing Metadata: Compare the existing metadata of your learning material to the RDA schema. Identify which fields are already populated and which are missing. Assess the quality and accuracy of the existing metadata. Populate Missing Fields: For each missing mandatory field, provide appropriate values based on the content of the learning material. Use controlled vocabularies where applicable (e.g., for subject terms). Ensure that the values are accurate, complete, and relevant. Improve Existing Metadata: Review the existing metadata for accuracy and completeness. If necessary, revise or expand the values to better align with the RDA schema and the FAIR principles. Pay particular attention to fields that impact Findability and Interoperability (e.g., Title, Identifier). Use Controlled Vocabularies: Identify relevant vocabularies for your community and select applicable fields in the schema. Assign Persistent Identifiers (PIDs) (If Applicable): If possible, devise a standardised approach to assign a persistent identifier (PID) to the learning material. This will ensure that the resource can be reliably located and cited. If you think PIDs are not an option in this case, discuss potential options with your trainer. Document Your Changes: Use Google Docs (or a similar document) to record the changes you make to the metadata. Note the original metadata (if any) and the updated values. Explain the rationale for your changes. Discuss and Refine: Discuss your metadata enhancements with your group and trainer. Refine your metadata based on feedback and suggestions. Tips: Be thorough and accurate in your metadata creation. Pay attention to detail and ensure consistency across all fields. Use clear and concise language. Remember that metadata is essential for making learning materials Findable and Interoperable. If you are unsure about a field, ask your trainer for guidance. Use the FAIRness assessment to guide your decisions. Remember to document the process. Part 4: Attribution Steps: The TASL Method: Review the TASL method: Title: What is the title of the work? Author: Who created the work? Source: Where did you find the work? License: What license is the work under? How each element contributes to proper attribution? Identify All Reused Resources: Carefully examine the learning material and identify all resources used (e.g., images, videos, text excerpts, data sets). Make a list of these resources. Check Existing Attributions: For each resource, check if there is an existing attribution. Assess if the attribution is complete and accurate. Identify any missing elements or errors. Apply the TASL Method: For each resource, use the TASL method to create a complete and accurate attribution. Ensure that all four elements (Title, Author, Source, License) are included. If any information is missing, research and find it. Enhance Attributions: How to ensure that the attributions are clearly visible and accessible (e.g., near the resource, in a separate attribution section)? Verify Licensing Information: Double-check the licensing information for each resource. Ensure that the license is compatible with the overall license of the learning material. If using Creative Commons licenses, ensure that they are correctly applied and attributed. Document Your Changes: Use Google Docs (or a similar document) to record the changes you make to the attributions. Note the original attribution (if any) and the updated attribution. Explain the rationale for your changes. Discuss and Refine: Discuss your attribution enhancements with your group and trainer. Refine your attributions based on feedback and suggestions. Tips: Be thorough and accurate in your attribution. Pay attention to detail and ensure consistency across all attributions. Use clear and concise language.
